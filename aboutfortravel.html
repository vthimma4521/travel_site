	  <h1>Tokyo: The Heart of Modern Japan</h1>
	  <p><img src="travel_pictures/tokyopic.jpg" width="350" height="267" alt=""/><span style="font-family: amboy-inline, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 16px;">The heart of modern day japan,</span> is a must-see destination in Japan. After becoming the new capital of Japan in 1603 after Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu unified Japan, it was renamed Edo in 1868, and quickly grew to heights never before seen in Japan's history, at a rate of industrialization never before seen previously; it is a super city that represents Japan's exploits in the 20th-21st centuries. Foriegners often find that Tokyo (along with Osaka) are the best places to start their new lives due to the modern ammenities, and travelers will find that many tourist destinations are easily accessible within the city through its timely public transport.</p><p>Tokyo is chalk rich with many tasty restraunts (chains and mom 'n pops), a rich culture (it is famous for its incorporated shrines and temples), media references and attractions (Shinjuku is great for this but it can get tiring; also check out the many attractions, like the arcades and themed restraunts), and more. If you're a traveler, add Tokyo to your list, and if you plan to move here, consider working in Tokyo!&nbsp;</p>

	  <h1>Kyoto: The Center of Old Japan</h1>
	  <p><img src="travel_pictures/kyotopic.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-family: amboy-inline, 'sans-serif;'">This is traditional Japan as you imagined it</span>—geisha (once the term for famous prostitutes) in brightly coloured kimonos emerging from wooden teahouses, forests of bamboo, temples and shrines in gold and silver and scarlet, raked gravel Zen gardens, intricate feasts served on lacquered plates, graceful tea ceremonies, traditional architecture laden with swooping roofs, ornate yet orderly panels, impressive wood structure, and Shinto gates, along with markets full of intriguing but unidentifiable ingredients.</p><p>The concrete high-rises of downtown Kyoto can be disappointing, so head out towards the mountains to the surrounding neighbourhoods where you’ll find narrow stone streets, old wooden houses, monks in flowing robes, and the sounds of chanting and gongs from the many temples and shrines. Gion is the place to spot geisha, Higashiyama has many beautiful temples to explore, and Arashiyama, up in the western hills, is one of the most traditional neighbourhoods and home to bamboo groves, quirky temples, and monkeys. Kyoto is one of the top Japanese travel spots for both tourists and nationals, so add it on your must-see destinations list, whether you plan to learn more about Japan's olden-day culture as a tourist or new gaijin citizen.</p>

	  <h1>Nikko: Religion at its Finest</h1>
	  <p><img src="travel_pictures/nikkopic.jpg" width="350" height="232" alt=""/><span style="font-family: amboy-inline, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 16px;">Nikko is a temple town and UNESCO world heritage site</span> in the mountains a few hours north of Tokyo and makes a cool retreat from the city. The area is famous for its vibrant autumn colours. The temples and shrines with their vermillion gates and moss-covered stone lanterns are scattered on the wooded hillside, and are truly a spirtual site to see and experience.</p> 
	  <p>The main attraction is Toshogu Shrine, a stunning complex with more than a dozen lavishly decorated red and gold buildings amongst huge, ancient cedar trees. The crowds can be overwhelming, so afterwards head to one of the quieter shrines.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Don't miss:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Visiting Toshogu Shrine early to avoid the crowds</li>
		<li>Playing games at atmospheric Futarasan-jinja</li>
		<li>Exploring Taiyuinbyo</li>
		<li>Hiking up the mountain to the peaceful Takino shrine</li>
		<li>Photographing the bright red Shinkyo bridge</li>
		<li>Munching on dango (grilled rice balls on a stick) from a street stall</li>

	  <h1>Honorary Mentions: Osaka, Mt. Haruna</h1>
	  <p><img src="travel_pictures/osakapic.jpeg" width="370" height="240" alt=""/><span style="font-family: amboy-inline, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 16px;">Osaka is a Japan must-see for many visitors.</span> The neon craziness of Dotonburi, the amazing food (for vegetarians too), friendly people, affordable prices, and the scary rides and brilliant Harry Potter and Nintento attractions at Universal Studios Japan make it an amazing place to visit. However, for short-term travels, choosing to visit only one out of Osaka or Tokyo is advisable, as they are both sprawling modern cities. Shinsaibashi is a great place to stay in Osaka as it is quit but close to lots of cool shops and restaurants and within walking distance of Dotonburi. It’s also very spacious compared to Tokyo. &nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="travel_pictures/harunaimg.jpg" width="350" height="196" alt=""/><span style="font-family: amboy-inline, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 16px;">Mt. Haruna, and it's surrounding town, Gunma, are unmissable for fans</span> of the Eurobeat and drifting made eternally popular by <em>Initial D</em>. Mt. Haruna was changed to Akina in the show in order to throw off over-enthusiastic fans, but it seems this didn't work, as speedbumps were added. Super-fans can visit the pass to see where modern day drifting subculture was arguably born, and as you stand amongst the damaged guardraling, Haruna's lake, and the gutter in the side of the road, you can feel the emotions that both lead to the creation of real and animated drifting. Try visiting the Initial D themed restraunt (sadly, the Tofu shop Bunta Fujiwara's shop was based off of was torn down) and maybe you can catch a glimpse at one of the Akina 86s or RedSuns' Rx-7s cruising around!</p>
